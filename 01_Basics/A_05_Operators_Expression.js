 console.log("comp != comp2 is",comp1 != comp2);
 console.log("comp === comp2 is",comp1 === comp2); // it compares its values and also its type , also called strict check.
 console.log("comp !== comp2 is",comp1 !== comp2); // it compares not equal value and not equal type

// three logical operator logical and, logical or, logical not

let a = 6;

console.log(null > 0);
console.log(null >= 0);

/*
the reason is that the equality check == and comparison >, < , >=, <= work

comparision convert null to a number, treating it as 0.
that's why {null >= 0} is true and {null > 0} is false .*/
